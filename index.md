# About Me

I am a M.S. student at IIIT Hyderabad. I am advised by [Prof. C. V. Jawahar](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~jawahar/) and [Prof. P. K. Vinod](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~vinod.pk).
I am broadly interested in machine learning and computer vision. Specifically my research is focused on representation learning on medical imaging tasks.
